# Shop List Project

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Overview

This project is a simple shopping list app made with TypeScript and plain JavaScript. I haven't been coding JavaScript for a while, so I thought it would be fun to make something practical like a shopping list to get back into it.

The main idea was to build a basic app where you can add items to your shopping list, mark them as bought, and remove them when you're done. I used TypeScript to make sure the code is more organized and less prone to errors.

## Features

- Add Items: Easily put things on your shopping list.
- Remove Items: Take things off the list with a click.
- Mark Completed: Tick off items you've bought.
- Clear List: Start fresh by clearing everything from the list.
- Type Safety: TypeScript helps catch mistakes in the code early on.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: A tool that helps write safer JavaScript code.
- DOM API: Using JavaScript to change what's on the webpage.
- HTML/CSS: Basic stuff for how the app looks and behaves.

## Getting Started

To use this app:

1. Open terminal in your computer.
2. run command `git clone https://github.com/nijat-niyazov/shop-list-vanilla-ts.git`
3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
4. Start managing your shopping list!
