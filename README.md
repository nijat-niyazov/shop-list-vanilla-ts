# Shop List Project

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Overview

This project is a simple shopping list app made with TypeScript and plain JavaScript. I haven't been coding JavaScript for a while, so I thought it would be fun to make something practical like a shopping list to get back into it.

The main idea was to build a basic app where you can add items to your shopping list, mark them as bought, and remove them when you're done. I used TypeScript to make sure the code is more organized and less prone to errors.

## Features

- Add Items: Easily put things on your shopping list.
- Remove Items: Take things off the list with a click.
- Mark Completed: Tick off items you've bought.
- Clear List: Start fresh by clearing everything from the list.
- Type Safety: TypeScript helps catch mistakes in the code early on.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: A tool that helps write safer JavaScript code.
- DOM API: Using JavaScript to change what's on the webpage.
- HTML/CSS: Basic stuff for how the app looks and behaves.

## Getting Started

To use this app:

1. Copy the code from the repository to your computer.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Start managing your shopping list!
4. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
